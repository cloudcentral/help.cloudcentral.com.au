## Project tab

Projects are organizational units in the cloud and are also known as tenants or accounts. Each user is a member of one or more projects. Within a project, a user creates and manages instances.

From the Project tab, you can view and manage the resources in a selected project, including instances and images. You can select the project from the drop-down menu at the top left. If the cloud supports multi-domain model, you can also select the domain from this menu.
